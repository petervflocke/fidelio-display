# fidelio-display
Arduino library for the Philips Fidelio DS1100 display based on PT6964 Led Driver IC
This is a fork from https://github.com/motote/fidelio-display now refactored from pure software serial communication to SPI.
Tested on ESP32, small AVR will work soon :)
For an example check the main.cpp in src folder.
